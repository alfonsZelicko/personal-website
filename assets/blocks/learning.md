## Learning

### Experimental Lab

- **Tools:** Python, PyTorch, MCP (Model Context Protocol)

I enjoy exploring the practical limits of AI and modern prototyping. Rather than following hype, I
prefer hands-on experimentation to understand how these technologies can be integrated into
real-world applications.

> Lately, I’ve been building an "AI storyteller for D&D" as a POC. It’s a mix of Django, htmx, and
> MCP, incorporating AI voices and custom context to see how far we can push interactive
> storytelling today.
