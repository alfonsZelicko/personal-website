### Product & Domain Experience

I am a **front-end specialist** with a full-stack background. I spent my first decade building
systems from the ground up before the "front-end boom" redefined the industry. This evolution allows
me to maintain a high-level view of the entire product lifecycle—focusing on usability, long-term
maintainability, and making **pragmatic technical decisions** based on real-world needs.

- **Customer-Facing Products**: I can act as the bridge between a client's vision and the
  development team—helping to formulate technical requirements, create cost estimates, and ensure
  the final product solves the actual business problem.
- **Strategic UI Engineering**: I distinguish between "making a UI change" and "solving a UI
  problem." I focus on improving user experience while keeping the implementation cost-effective and
  maintainable.
- **Industry 4.0**: With years of experience building DAQ systems, I provide a deep understanding of
  industrial environments, hardware-software integration, and the specific challenges of Industry
  4.0.

### Engineering & Frontend Stack

- **Primary**: TypeScript/JavaScript, React (16.8+), HTML/CSS (SCSS, Less)
- **Secondary/Legacy**: Svelte, Angular, htmx, jQuery (3.0+)
- **Favorite support**: Material UI/Tailwind/Bootstrap, Tanstack, Nx, Cypress...

The front-end landscape is vast, and I make a conscious effort to maintain a broad overview of how
different frameworks and technologies solve common problems. This perspective allows me to choose
the **right tool [based on team strengths](http://mikhailian.mova.org/node/284)** rather than just
following the latest hype.

I prefer PWA over **React native**, but in the future I am planning to convert some of my personal
projects into [full Android/iOS apps](experience/learning/#future-tech-radar)... all that new
possibilities!

### Back-End & Architecture

- **Languages**: Currently primary focus on **Python** and **TypeScript/JS** (Node.js), with a solid
  professional background in Java (Spring Boot)
- **Foundations**: Once upon a time I spent several years maintaining legacy projects in _Pascal_
  and _C/C++_, later _PHP_

I can architect and deliver back-end services, but my core focus has shifted entirely to the
front-end. Today, I’m most effective as architectural support—ensuring seamless API integration and
actually meaningful error handling rather than coding the back-end from scratch.

> only reinforce my caution regarding JS on the server >:-).

### Data & Persistence

Since the database was often the client’s choice, I learned to treat it as a swappable component. I
focus on portable data modeling that works across relational, NoSQL, or cloud-native systems,
avoiding vendor-specific "hacks" unless a bottleneck truly demands a specialized solution.

> SQLite, Redis, Firebase, DynamoDB — these are just tools to me. Each has its purpose, and we
> should always be prepared to switch to the one that fits our needs better, if the specs change.

### Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Scripting & OS**: OS-agnostic approach using Bash and Batch (.bat)
- **CI/CD**: **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, Jenkins, **TeamCity**
- **Tools**: Docker, Nginx, Apache, Basic AWS exposure

I am not a dedicated DevOps engineer, but I am fully self-sufficient when it comes to managing my
own projects. I can navigate infrastructure boundaries, set up pipelines, and handle deployments
independently... but I prefer not to :-)

### Team & Process Leadership

- **Team Lead**: Mentoring, onboarding, technical decision-making, and unblocking daily hurdles
- **Agile & Workflow**: Full lifecycle management (Scrum, Waterfall)
- **Team Dynamics**: Identifying "Bus Factor" risks, stabilizing teams and more based on context
- **Stakeholder communication**: Roadmap execution and technical consulting

When leading, I drive a culture of developer satisfaction and shared ownership. My goal is a stable
team with no "heroes," high knowledge redundancy, and code written with our "future selves" in mind.

> Full Agile is pretty expansive, but can help to find/identify problems -> then i prefer to switch
> in some lightweight mutation of it.
