#### Introduction

My name is Alfons Zelicko, a software developer focused mainly on front-end and **user oriented**
applications. I am open for freelance or consultancy projects, start-up help or web development. If
the project would be really interesting, long term, and with **chance to meet colleagues in
person**, I am also not afraid of **full time job**.

#### Work

I focus on front-end and web technologies, building interfaces that are as robust as they are
responsive. My approach is rooted in direct collaboration—I don’t just take requirements; I work
with clients to uncover their **actual needs**.

I’m a big believer in **pragmatic engineering**: knowing exactly when to optimize for immediate
performance and when to build a clean, flexible foundation that’s ready for **future scaling**. To
see how I'm currently pushing my boundaries, check out my [learning page](/learning).

> The greatest satisfaction for me comes when users enjoy working with the software, finding it
> intuitive and effortless to use.

#### Career

Computers were always a natural part of my life, and when the boom of web technologies arrived, it
felt like a very natural next step. The web and front-end development matched my idea of how modern
software should work — accessible, interactive, and built around users. Since then, I have been
mainly focused on building websites and web applications using modern tools, architectures, and
approaches.

#### Education

My technical background started early, with my first small programs and Excel macros during
elementary school. In high school I focused on
<a href="https://www.spst.cz/" target="_blank">computer systems</a> and later studied
<a href="https://www.susg.cz/" target="_blank">graphic design</a> as a distance program. At
university, my studies continued in <a href="https://www.fit.vut.cz/.cs" target="_blank">applied
informatics</a> and <a href="https://www.vspj.cz/cs/" target="_blank">economics &amp;
management</a>. Over time, these areas naturally blended into a single skill set, which I keep
developing and extending with new technologies and **ways of thinking**.

> I believe a programmer must keep running just to stay in the same place, and a front-end developer
> needs a motorcycle to keep up with the speed of change.

> School can teach you syntax and algorithms, but real programming teaches you how to think
> pragmatically and solve problems in the real world.

#### Leisure

In last years I mostly listen audiobooks, mainly sci-fi, philosophy and history. I really enjoy
discussions and debates, and I even competed in them in the past. Among authors I like most are
people such as <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2" target="_blank">Yuval Noah
Harari</a> or <a href="https://chomsky.info/books/" target="_blank">Noam Chomsky</a>.

> I sometimes joke that I would love to see an event where Noam Chomsky sits on a simple wooden
> chair with a glass of water, while someone like Niall Ferguson sits opposite in a leather armchair
> with a cup of Earl Grey, and they argue about whether the West is good or bad...

I also like playing TTRPG games, some video games, and I do climbing – indoor walls, rocks and via
ferratas. Hiking and cycling are also big part of my free time.

#### Website

I decided to build [this website](/website) ideally **without JavaScript** and with very
**minimalistic graphics**. It is inspired by times when the web was simpler, when EDGE was still
considered top tier of internet browsing - and not just poor browser, and by the iconic series of
websites like <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/" target="_blank">The Best Motherfucking
Website</a>, which celebrate straightforward, no-frills design and content-first approach.

> This website is around 62 KB, fully responsive, and compatible with all modern browsers. The
> entire site is built in about 25 ms (with minification), most of UX works without JS
