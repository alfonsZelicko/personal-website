### My Framework Stress-Test

I stopped chasing every new framework long ago. Instead, I try to understand the "soul" of the
technology. Whether it's the latest frontend hype or a new backend engine, I always look for the
same basic answers:

- **How does it handle change?** _(Is it "pushing" updates or constantly recalculating everything?)_
- **How do data get to the user?** _(Is it a smooth stream or a clunky "wait-for-load" experience?)_
- **How does it stay organized?** _(How do different parts of the app talk to each other without
  creating a mess?)_

If a framework can't give me a clear, pragmatic answer to these, it’s just more syntax to
memorize—and I’m not interested in that. I’d rather master the principles that stay the same while
the tools change.

> You've probably guessed by now—I'm mainly talking about front-end here.

#### How I learn new technology

1. **Why & What:** Why does it exist? What pain point does it solve? (Don't touch the code yet).
2. **The "Hate-Test":** Search for _"Why [Tech] sucks"_ on Reddit/X. Find the architectural
   "gotchas" early.
3. **The First Contact:** Standard "Hello World" and installation.
4. **Mind Mapping:** Dive into core concepts. Identify unique patterns and "learning debt."
5. **Reverse Engineering:** Break the official demos. See how the system reacts to chaos.
6. **Targeted Deep Dive:** Read the heavy API docs only after feeling the practical friction.
7. **Micro-Project:** Build something real. Solve routing, forms, and data fetching.
8. **Synthesis:** Connect it to the universal mental model. **Project + Notes = Retention.**
