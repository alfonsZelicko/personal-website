Having experienced both the freelance world and full-time roles, I’ve learned that I thrive most
when I can **stay with one company for years**. I value building **long-term synergy with a team**
and having enough time to truly master the domain. For me, it’s about professional growth and
**never leaving a job unfinished**.

During the years I developed a **prefered dev environment** - more about [here](/environment).

## The Journey

### Current Mission | Sabbatical & AI Orchestration

_2024 – Present_

After years of shifting between critical infrastructure and high-stakes broadcast engineering, I
decided to take a step back and focus on my most important "long-term project": **my son**. However,
I’ve repurposed my professional drive into exploring the bleeding edge of AI, treating it as a new
frontier for system orchestration. I am working on few projects - more about them in
[learning page](/experience/learning) and i am planning to make a few new.

#### The Next Chapter: Looking for a Team

While personal projects keep me sharp, **I miss the impact of a professional environment** and the
logic of systems that operate at scale. I’m ready to end my sabbatical for an opportunity where
engineering **decisions actually matter**.

I'm looking for a team that values pragmatic, sustainable builds—whether we are starting from
scratch or untangling a complex legacy system. If you need an engineer who thinks in systems,
prioritizes clarity over hype (and occasionally over-engineers his fridge), **let’s talk!**
