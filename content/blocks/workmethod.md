## Working Method

- Methods I employ to deliver elegant, efficient, and maintainable code that adds long-term value to
  the product.
- Pragmatic Architecture:
  [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
  and [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) principles to the front-end to keep
  business logic independent of UI frameworks.
- State of Mind: Application structure guided by
  [12-Factor App principles](https://12factor.net/)—ensuring environments are consistent and
  deployments are boring (in a good way).
- Quality over Hype: Choosing the right tool for the job, prioritizing stability and performance
  over the latest industry trends.
- Technical Debt Management: Proactive prevention of technical debt through continuous refactoring
  and clear documentation.
- DevSecOps & Security: Embracing Secure by Design. Front-end isn't just about pixels; it's about
  sanitization, secure headers, and protecting user data.
- Modern Versioning: Everything in Git, versioned according to
  [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), with transparent CI/CD pipelines and automatic
  changelog generation.
- Test-Driven Logic: Using TDD for complex domain logic and critical paths where manual testing is
  not enough.
- Ethical Engineering: Adhering to the ACM Code of Ethics and supporting Open Source ecosystems
  whenever possible.
