## Working Method

- Methods I employ to deliver elegant, efficient, and maintainable code that adds long-term value to
  the product.
- Pragmatic Architecture: Applying Clean Architecture and DDD principles to the front-end to keep
  business logic independent of UI frameworks.
- State of Mind: Application structure guided by 12-Factor App principles—ensuring environments are
  consistent and deployments are boring (in a good way).
- Quality over Hype: Choosing the right tool for the job, prioritizing stability and performance
  over the latest industry trends.
- Technical Debt Management: Proactive prevention of technical debt through continuous refactoring
  and clear documentation.
- DevSecOps & Security: Embracing Secure by Design. Front-end isn't just about pixels; it's about
  sanitization, secure headers, and protecting user data.
- Modern Versioning: Everything in Git, versioned according to Semantic Versioning, with transparent
  CI/CD pipelines.
- Test-Driven Logic: Using TDD for complex domain logic and critical paths where manual testing is
  not enough.
- Ethical Engineering: Adhering to the ACM Code of Ethics and supporting Open Source ecosystems
  whenever possible.
