## Education & Early Roots

**FIT VUT (Brno University of Technology)** | _Computer Science & Mathematics_

- **The Real CS:** Finally, a place where I could dive into sophisticated algorithms and the kind of
  "magic" that makes modern computing work. It provided deep insights into the systems I always
  found fascinating.
  > They told me: "Come work with us and finish your studies remotely." But we all know how that
  > goes. Every "boring homework" felt like a waste of time compared to doing real work with
  > professionals and getting paid for it. Real-world engineering won.

**College of Polytechnics Jihlava** | _Management and IT Studies_

- **The Integrity Test:** My studies here ended abruptly after a direct confrontation regarding
  system security and engineering ethics. This defining moment solidified my lifelong preference for
  technical competence and integrity over formal titles.
  > It’s a long and funny story, but it boiled down to a simple choice: either pay to "fix" a
  > security flaw in a system authored by the lecturer I disagreed with, or leave. I chose the
  > latter.

**Secondary School of Graphic Arts (Jihlava)** | _Graphic Design_

- **Visual Craft:** I studied this concurrently with my technical school to master the "other side"
  of software. It provided a "second pair of eyes" for UI/UX, typography, and aesthetic details that
  many engineers overlook.
  > Despite the training, I never learned to hand-paint realistic figures—every time I try, it
  > somehow turns into a caricature. (:o[

**Secondary School of Industry (SPŠT Třebíč)** | _Electronic Computer Systems_

- **The Genesis:** This is where I built my first Chess engine from scratch, obsessing over logic
  and rendering. While "heavy electricity" wasn't my cup of tea, the logic of digital systems
  definitely was.
- **National Success:** Winner of a national programming competition.

  > To be completely honest, the main competitor was out sick that day, but a win is a win!

### Honorable Mention: The Primary School Roots

**Primary School (ZŠ Valeč)** | _The Foundation of Critical Thinking_

- **The Mr. Mentor:** I had the privilege of being in the class of
  [Miloš Šlapal](https://www.kellnerfoundation.cz/pomahame-skolam-k-uspechu/lide/mgr-milos-slapal-clen-odborneho-tymu),
  now a renowned Czech expert on reading literacy and critical thinking.

  > It was his first school, and we were his "guinea pigs" for methods he later refined throughout
  > his career. Long before it was trendy, he merged Czech, History, and Civics into a single,
  > unorthodox block. It wasn’t about memorizing dates; it was about understanding how the world,
  > history, and people actually work... **If I tend to question everything and look for the "why"
  > behind the "what" today—it's largely thanks to him.**

- **The Folklore Experiment:** He once conducted a live "telephone game" to show how oral tradition
  works. A story was passed one-by-one through the class, gradually mutating until it reached me as
  a fragmented, senseless mess.
  - **The Turning Point:** Realizing the story had lost its meaning by the time it reached me, I
    instinctively reshaped it into a punchy, logical joke (which it wasn't at the start). From that
    moment on, the transmission stabilized—the joke was memorable enough to stay unchanged until the
    last student.

  > It was a profound (1st?) lesson in human psychology: information only survives if it has a clear
  > structure. Just like the famous collectors of folk tales, I saw firsthand how we "fix" history
  > by forcing it into a form that people actually remember.

- **The Lesson on Human Nature:** I remember a lesson about the Baroque era—how progress stalled,
  science was suppressed, and society shifted from the enlightened Renaissance toward dogmatic
  belief, prioritizing the word of the clergy over scientific reason. I couldn't wrap my head around
  _why_ anyone would willingly choose to go backward.
