## Education & Early Roots

**FIT VUT (Brno University of Technology)** _Computer Science & Mathematics_

- **The Real CS:** Finally, a place where I could dive into sophisticated algorithms and the kind of
  "magic" that makes modern computing work. It provided deep insights into the systems I always
  found fascinating.
  > They told me: "Come work with us and finish your studies remotely." But we all know how that
  > goes. Every "boring homework" felt like a waste of time compared to doing real work with
  > professionals and getting paid for it. Real-world engineering won.

**College of Polytechnics Jihlava** _Management and IT Studies_

- **The Integrity Test:** My studies here ended abruptly after a direct confrontation regarding
  system security and engineering ethics. This defining moment solidified my lifelong preference for
  technical competence and integrity over formal titles.
  > It’s a long and funny story, but it boiled down to a simple choice: either pay to "fix" a
  > security flaw in a system authored by the lecturer I disagreed with, or leave. I chose the
  > latter.

**Secondary School of Graphic Arts (Jihlava)** _Graphic Design_

- **Visual Craft:** I studied this concurrently with my technical school to master the "other side"
  of software. It provided a "second pair of eyes" for UI/UX, typography, and aesthetic details that
  many engineers overlook.
  > Despite the training, I never learned to hand-paint realistic figures—every time I try, it
  > somehow turns into a caricature. (:o[

**Secondary School of Industry (SPŠT Třebíč)** _Electronic Computer Systems_

- **The Genesis:** This is where I built my first Chess engine from scratch, obsessing over logic
  and rendering. While "heavy electricity" wasn't my cup of tea, the logic of digital systems
  definitely was.
- **National Success:** Winner of a national programming competition.
  > To be completely honest, the main competitor was out sick that day, but a win is a win!
