### ChyronHego Czech, s.r.o. | Senior Frontend Engineer

_2012 - 2018_ ~ **Broadcast Graphics & Interactive Media (3+ years)**

- **The "Bug-for-Bug" Challenge:** Engineered a React-based engine that translated complex broadcast
  graphics into interactive HTML. I had to achieve feature-parity with legacy quirks that had become
  industry standards over decades.
- **Pure JS Animation:** Since CSS couldn't provide the required precision for broadcast-grade
  timing, I built a custom animation engine in pure JavaScript, focusing on frame-rate stability and
  rendering pipeline optimization.
- **Scaling with Nx:** During a 5x team expansion, I championed the adoption of **Nx (Monorepos)**
  to centralize UI libraries and maintain architectural sanity across growing teams.

### Nuvia a.s. | Senior Software Engineer & Solution Architect

_2018 - 2021_ ~ **Industry 4.0 & Specialized Monitoring Systems (3 years)**

- **Strategic Visualization:** Developed an interactive hall monitoring system for manufacturing
  plants. By making real-time performance "visible" to management, I facilitated the expansion of
  our DAQ systems to international branches.
- **Critical Infrastructure:** Maintained and refactored databases for **nuclear waste
  repositories**. This role demanded 100% data integrity and a disciplined approach to working with
  highly certified legacy codebases.
- **Organizational Refactoring:** Modernized the internal engineering culture by defining clear
  FE/BE boundaries and introducing DevOps workflows (TeamCity, YouTrack) to replace manual,
  disorganized processes.

  > This [web about DAQIS](https://daqis.cz/) is quite old; I built it in about two days using
  > [minimal graphic tools](https://www.photopea.com/) and without _proper knowledge_ of the SW
  > sector (at that time). The very fact that it is still here without any changes (or at least an
  > added language mutation) speaks volumes ;-(

### The Digital Nomad Era | Full-stack Freelancer

_2012 - 2018_ ~ **Global**

- **Business & Communication:** While traveling, I focused on building e-commerce solutions and
  websites where I acted as both a consultant and developer.
- **Strategic Support**: Contributed to complex software projects as "deadline reinforcement". I
  chose roles where I could guarantee delivery despite the technical constraints of traveling.
- **Holistic Approach:** Leveraged my background in graphic arts to bridge the gap between
  aesthetics, SEO, and functional backend architecture.
- **RThe Remote Pioneer**: Long before remote work was the norm, I had to be a "process architect"
  for my clients. For many companies, I first had to design the environment and workflows—deployment
  pipelines, communication channels, and collaboration tools—just to make the delivery possible. It
  was a win-win: they gained a modern, scalable approach to development, and I mastered the art of
  "Remote-First" engineering.

> jQuery—it works, I still like the design, so why touch it? :-)

### Red-Hat | Software Engineer (Intern to Junior Dev)

_2010 - 2012_ ~ **JBoss Ecosystem**

- **Engineering Boot Camp:** My first exposure to professional, large-scale engineering. I
  specialized in reproducing and debugging complex issues within the JBoss environment.
- **Open Source Discipline:** Learned the importance of rigorous testing and documentation within a
  world-class team, forming the foundation of my pragmatic approach to code.[^1]

> This was my **second real job experience** (the first was an internship with
> [Pohoda](https://www.stormware.cz/)). In just one month there, I learned more about teamwork,
> programming, and software engineering than I had in the previous few years. During my time there,
> they were even voted the "Best Employer" in the Czech Republic. **It was a dream job** - for a
> while.
