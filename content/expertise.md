### Domain focus

- Web applications / Design
- frontend-heavy products
- internal business systems
- data acquisition (DAQ) systems, Industry 4.0
- e-commerce platforms...

I have long-term experience delivering software used in production by real users, ranging from
customer-facing products to internal tools. I place a strong emphasis on usability, maintainability,
and making pragmatic technical decisions based on real-world needs.

### Programming languages

- **JavaScript / TypeScript**
- **Python**
- Java
- PHP, C#

**Historical background:** VBA macros, Pascal, C, C++, Java (academic and early professional years).

My primary focus is on languages suitable for long-lived products and web-based systems, supported
by a solid understanding of programming fundamentals built over decades.

### Web & frontend engineering

- **HTML, CSS, SCSS**
- **React 16.8+** (Jotai, Zustand, Redux, ...)
- Svelte, Angular, htmx
- **jQuery** (legacy and long-term projects, v3.0+)

I deliver frontend applications from start to finish, whether collaborating on UI/UX designs or
working independently using tools like **Material UI** or **Tailwind**. I enjoy modernizing
interfaces built on legacy technologies to improve usability, maintainability, and the overall user
experience without breaking business continuity.

> strengths, current trends, and the long-term maintainability of the codebase.

### Backend & Architecture

I focus on backend architecture and proper layering, ensuring each part of the system handles its
specific responsibilities correctly. While I have a strong conceptual grasp of how a robust backend
should be structured to keep layers separated, I consider hands-on implementation in specific
frameworks a supporting skill rather than my primary daily focus. My experience includes building
APIs and services using **Java (Spring Boot)**, **Python (Django)**, **PHP**, and **Node.js**.

> only reinforce my caution regarding JS on the server >:-)

### Data & Persistence

Since the database was often the client’s choice, I learned to treat it as a swappable component. I
focus on portable data modeling that works across relational, NoSQL, or cloud-native systems,
avoiding vendor-specific "hacks" unless a bottleneck truly demands the right tool for the job.

> SQLite, Redis, Firebase, DynamoDB —these are just tools to me. Each has its purpose, and we should
> always be prepared to switch to the one that fits our needs better, if the specs change.

### Experimental Lab

- **Tools:** Python, PyTorch, MCP (Model Context Protocol)

I enjoy exploring the practical limits of AI and modern prototyping. Rather than following hype, I
prefer hands-on experimentation to understand how these technologies can be integrated into
real-world applications.

> Lately, I’ve been building an "AI storyteller for D&D" as a POC. It’s a mix of Django, htmx, and
> MCP, incorporating AI voices and custom context to see how far we can push interactive
> storytelling today.

### Infrastructure & Deployment

- **OS**: Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat environments), Windows
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, TeamCity
- **Tools**: Docker, Nginx, Apache, AWS exposure...

I am not a dedicated DevOps engineer, but I am fully self-sufficient when it comes to managing my
own projects. I can navigate infrastructure boundaries, set up pipelines, and handle deployments
independently.

> I’m the kind of developer who can dive into a DevOps pull request to fix a blocker or find a
> deployment bug when the ops team is busy. I don't wait for things to be fixed; I help fix them so
> the product can keep moving... **but i preffer not to** :-)

### Leadership & product responsibilities

- **Team & Growth**: Mentoring, onboarding developers, and unblocking technical hurdles
- **Business Bridge**: Customer communication, software sales, pre-sales, and technical consulting
- **Problem Solving**: Navigating complex cross-team dependencies and aligning technical solutions
  with business goals

I enjoy the intersection of high-level architecture and real-world business needs. I can talk to a
stakeholder about ROI and then turn around and guide a team through a complex implementation.

> to maintain.
