#### Introduction

My name is Alfons Zelicko, software developer focused mainly on front-end and **user oriented**
applications. I am open for freelance or consultancy projects, start-up help or web development. If
the project would be really interesting, long term, and with **chance to meet colleagues in
person**, I am also not afraid of full time job.

#### Work

I focus mainly on front-end and web technologies, building user interfaces and responsive layouts
with modern tools. I enjoy **collaborating with clients** to understand their **real needs**, while
carefully deciding when to **optimize immediately** and when to leave code ready for **later
improvement**.

> The greatest satisfaction for me comes when users enjoy working with the software, finding it
> intuitive and effortless to use.

#### Career

Computers were always a natural part of my life, and when the boom of web technologies arrived, it
felt like a very natural next step. The web and front-end development matched my idea of how modern
software should work — accessible, interactive, and built around users. Since then, I have been
mainly focused on building websites and web applications using modern tools, architectures, and
approaches.

#### Education

My technical background started early, with my first small programs and Excel macros during
elementary school. In high school I focused on
<a href="https://www.spst.cz/" target="_blank">computer systems</a> and later studied
<a href="https://www.susg.cz/" target="_blank">graphic design</a> as a distance program. At
university, my studies continued in <a href="https://www.fit.vut.cz/.cs" target="_blank">computer
systems</a> and <a href="https://www.vspj.cz/cs/" target="_blank">economics &amp; management</a>.
Over time, these areas naturally blended into a single skill set, which I keep developing and
extending with new technologies and **ways of thinking**.

> I believe programmer must keep running to stay in same place, and front-end developer needs even
> motorcycle to keep up with speed of changes.

> School can teach you syntax and algorithms, but real programming teaches you how to think
> pragmatically and solve problems in the real world.

#### Leisure

In last years I mostly listen audiobooks, mainly sci-fi, philosophy and history. I really enjoy
discussions and debates, and I even competed in them in the past. Among authors I like most are
people such as <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2" target="_blank">Yuval Noah
Harari</a> or <a href="https://chomsky.info/books/" target="_blank">Noam Chomsky</a>.

> I sometimes joke that I would love to see an event where Noam Chomsky sits on a simple wooden
> chair with a glass of water, while someone like Niall Ferguson sits opposite in a leather armchair
> with a cup of Earl Grey, and they argue about whether the West is good or bad...

I also like playing TTRPG games, some video games, and I do climbing – indoor walls, rocks and via
ferratas. Hiking and cycling are also big part of my free time.

#### Website

I decided to build this website ideally **without JavaScript** and with very **minimalistic
graphics**. It is inspired by times when the web was simpler, when EDGE was still considered top
tier of internet browsing, and by the iconic series of websites like
<a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/" target="_blank">The Best Motherfucking Website</a>,
which celebrate straightforward, no-frills design and content-first approach.

> This website is around 62 KB, fully responsive, and compatible with all modern browsers. All web
> is build in about 25 ms (with minifcation), most of UX works without JS

> This web was developed using the static website generator Hugo (written in Golang).
