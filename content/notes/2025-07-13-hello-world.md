Welcome to my _Notes_ section! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, discoveries, and guides on
various topics.

## Why Notes Instead of Blog?

I prefer the term "notes" because it feels more casual and authentic. These aren't polished blog
posts - they're my genuine thoughts and discoveries that I want to share.

## Features

- **RSS Feed**: Stay updated with new notes
- **Categories**: Easy filtering and discovery
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices

## Coming Soon

I'm planning to add:

- Comment system (mby?)
  - [x] implement [giscus.app](https://giscus.app/)
  - [ ] contribute on custom theme for my web :-/ (transparent?/two colors?/add new param for css
        source?)
- Tags support
- Full-text search (with JS)

_This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more interesting content!_
